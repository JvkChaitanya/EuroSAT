# EuroSAT
The EuroSAT dataset includes imagery categorised into 10 distinct land cover classes: Industrial, Residential, Annual Crop, Permanent Crop, River, Sea & Lake, Herbaceous Vegetation, Highway, Pasture, and Forest. Each class contains a varying number of images corresponding to its specific category, collectively amounting to a total of 27,000 images. These images are derived from Sentinel-2 satellite data and span 13 spectral bands, enabling a comprehensive analysis of land cover types. The 13 spectral bands include: Coastal Aerosol, Blue, Green, Red, Red Edge 1, Red Edge 2, Red Edge 3, Near Infrared (NIR), Narrow Near Infrared, Water Vapor, Cirrus, Shortwave Infrared 1 (SWIR1) and Shortwave Infrared 2 (SWIR2)
